For mobile browsers or users with dial-up connections, simpler is better.  So I wrote an open source \u003ca href\u003d\"http://nonjslocalsearch.appspot.com\"\u003enon-JavaScript version of Google Maps\u003c/a\u003e which is designed to show how easy it is to write an application on App Engine that makes use of two new APIs from Google: The Static Maps API and the Local Search API's REST interface.  It doesn't have advanced features like street view and public transportation, but it gives you a searchable map that you can zoom in/out on as well as save locations.  It also automatically saves your last map view so that every time you go back to the site it will show you what you were last looking at.  Check out the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-examples/source/browse/trunk/nonjslocalsearch/localSearch.py\"\u003esource code\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIt uses \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/appengine/\"\u003eApp Engine\u003c/a\u003e to store saved points, the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/#fonje\"\u003eAJAX LocalSearch REST API\u003c/a\u003e for search functionality, and the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/\"\u003eStatic Maps API\u003c/a\u003e to display maps.  App Engine is easy to learn and the data store is useful for this kind of application.  The REST API for LocalSearch is also very simple.  For more information on it, go \u003ca href\u003d\"http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2008/05/non-javascript-localsearch.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nTo use the Static Maps API, you just need to create a URL with the proper parameters for your desired map view.  Keep in mind that you need to set the zoom level (unless you are specifying multiple points \u0026mdash; then it's calculated for you).  In the vast majority of cases, this is completely fine.  In my case, though, I needed to know what the zoom level was, so that I could give the user the option to zoom in/out. That meant coming up with calculations of the zoom both for the multiple points and single point case, and that was the trickiest part of the app. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIf you use the AJAX Local Search and it returns one result then there will be a viewport object returned with it.  This viewport contains the Northeast and Southwest latitude/longitude bounds that are optimal for displaying this point.  However, Static Maps only accept zoom levels and center points.  Here's the Python to generate that information:\n\u003cpre class\u003d\"code\"\u003eviewport \u003d json['responseData']['viewport']\nmercator_projection \u003d MercatorProjection(18) # Checkout the MercatorProjection class\nsouthwest \u003d [float(viewport['sw']['lat']),float(viewport['sw']['lng'])]\nnortheast \u003d [float(viewport['ne']['lat']),float(viewport['ne']['lng'])]\nbounds \u003d [southwest, northeast]\nzoom_level \u003d mercator_projection.CalculateBoundsZoomLevel(bounds, MAP_SIZE)\u003c/pre\u003eAt this point you will have everything you need to construct the map: the center point (the Local Search point), zoom level, marker point.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThen there's the case where you have multiple points returned by the AJAX Local Search.  Since we will have a collection of latitudes and longitude points that we want to display we can just find the min/maxes, do some rounding, and voilà you get a bounding box.  With a bounding box and a calculated center point, you can repeat the same steps as before.\n\u003cpre class\u003d\"code\"\u003emercator_projection \u003d MercatorProjection(18)\nbounds \u003d CalcBoundsFromPoints(lats, lngs)\ncenter_point \u003d CalcCenterFromBounds(bounds)\nzoom_level \u003d mercator_projection.CalculateBoundsZoomLevel(bounds, MAP_SIZE)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFrom line \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-examples/source/browse/trunk/nonjslocalsearch/localSearch.py#121\"\u003e121\u003c/a\u003e to about \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-examples/source/browse/trunk/nonjslocalsearch/localSearch.py#285\"\u003e285\u003c/a\u003e you'll find all the necessary functions for the situations described above.

Last year, we announced the ability to include KML/GeoRSS files in regular sitemaps just like a normal web resource. This year, we announce a special extension for sitemaps that adds geo-specific tags and makes it easier for us to index.

As of last week, it can now be used to retrieve any of the content we have in our geo index. There are a couple different ways to do this, depending on how you use the API. If you're using the LocalSearchControl, here's some sample code (and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.google.com/uds/solutions/localsearch/default.html\"\u003elive example\u003c/a\u003e) that will return blended results:\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\nvar options \u003d {\n  listingTypes : GlocalSearch.TYPE_BLENDED_RESULTS\n}\nmap.addControl(new google.maps.LocalSearch(options));\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\nIf you're using the Local Search API from Javascript, here's some sample code to return only results from indexed geo files:\n\u003cpre\u003e\nvar ls \u003d new GlocalSearch();\nls.setRestriction(GSearch.RESTRICT_TYPE, GlocalSearch.TYPE_KMLONLY_RESULTS);\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\nAnd finally, if you're using the Local Search API from somewhere other than Javascript - for example, with our new nifty Maps API for Flash - here's some sample AS3 code (and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://gmaps-samples-flash.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/LocalSearcher.html\"\u003elive example\u003c/a\u003e) to return only results from indexed geo files PLUS add a site restrict operator to limit it to results from platial.com:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\nservice.url \u003d 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/local';\nservice.request.q \u003d \"site: platial.com\" + \" \" +  address.text;\nservice.request.mrt \u003d \"kmlonly\";\nservice.addEventListener(ResultEvent.RESULT, onServerResponse);\nservice.send();\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThere are (atleast) two really cool consequences of this news: 1) you'll be able to enable users of your mashups to instantly find international results where previously none existed, and to be able to find results for non-standard searches (e.g. \"dog parks\"), and 2) by indexing your content, waiting a few weeks, and then using the local search with a \"site:yourdomain.com\" appended to the query, you get to leverage the power of google search on your own content with barely any code of your own. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nSo what are you waiting for?

The ability to utilize the power of Google Maps from Flash is one of those requests that has been popping up on blog posts and other forums since the beginning of time (or more accurately, the beginning of the Javascript Maps API). Over the past few hours, I've had the enjoyment of finally seeing this particular feature request - a Maps API for Flash - come to fruition. Tiredness will grab me soon, no doubt. If you're one of the first readers of this post, rest assured that I'm unlikely to still be awake: long hours have been worked; pre-launch nerves have jangled. Now it's time to let our baby loose into the world and see how the developer community will embrace it.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nSo, what do I like about the API for Flash? Smoothness and speed are a \u003cb\u003ebig\u003c/b\u003e part of it. We've designed it so that Flash graphics can be used for each tile layer, marker and info window - opening up possibilities like dynamic shading, shadowing, animation, and video. When the user zooms the map, magnification changes happen smoothly and place names fade in. After the user drags a marker, it gently bounces to a halt. Generally, Flash allows for much greater embellishment, and, well... \"flashiness.\" I get excited just thinking about the creative ways developers might take advantage of having a Flash API for Google Maps.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhat was one of our main design decisions for this project? We knew that version 1 of any software project is not perfect, so we opted to split the interface and implementation.  As a result, you can build against the current version of the API, and as we add enhancements and tweaks, your website benefits automatically from each update. When you wish to take advantage of new API functions, only then do you need to download the latest API and rebuild.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhat does it look like? We've played with it, thrown our ideas in, and also worked with outside companies to see how they use the API. It's been a pleasure to see some of the demos that have come back. Here's one from \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.afcomponents.com/\"\u003eAFComponents\u003c/a\u003e that shows some of the possibilities:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width\u003d625 height\u003d275 frameborder\u003d0 src\u003d\"http://gmaps-samples-flash.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/AFCVideoSyncMap/AFCVideoSyncMap.html\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhen I first joined Google in Sydney, I got to hear about the experience of the Maps team when they first watched the traffic and the buzz build for the launch of Google Maps.

Besides having 6 great talks and more than 20,000 YouTube video views, we also met a bunch of local developers working on geo projects (thanks for always showing up, you guys), and even met some folks from far away through the mailing list.

Street View allows users to view 3D panoramas of various locations around the world and to navigate around neighborhoods as if they were (almost) really there.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe've worked hard to ensure that Street View in the API gives developers the power and control they need to embed this functionality in their own websites in whatever way they wish. The API allows you to embed one or multiple panoramas in any location on a site and move, remove, hide and unhide them as necessary. Panoramas can also be easily integrated with the rest of the Google Maps API to allow synchronization between the map and the panorama viewer. The blue tile layer overlays which show where Street View data is available can be added to your own maps using the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GStreetviewOverlay\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eGStreetviewOverlay\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e class.

How else would I have discovered that other languages have such pretty swirly letters? Unfortunately, it's also quite a frustrating experience when you're actually trying to find some place in those countries (\"Tokyo! SHOW ME TOKYO!! aRrrgghghH!\"). Well, thankfully the Google Maps team has now made it easier to have both an educational and satisfying experience with \u003ca href\u003d\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2008/02/are-we-going-to-greece-or-thailand.html\"\u003ethe recent introduction\u003c/a\u003e of transliterated tiles for Russia, Greece, Japan, and Thailand. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor users with a browser setting for the native languages of those countries, they'll continue seeing the tiles with just the labels in that language.

I am pleased to report that although the API is in its early stages, it provides enough functionality to easily convey valuable geo-based information (e.g. the top 10 severe traffic incidents surrounding an airport) for our mobile users.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nSo why are static maps so important to mobile? Well, mobile development is kind of the old Wild West of the internet. Different phones use different browsers: some are common browsers like Opera, while others are proprietary ones written by the device manufacturer.  This means you cannot count on universal support for Javascript and Ajax, and therefore there is no way to use the Google Maps Javascript API for people on cell phones and PDAs.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOk, enough of the history lesson, click on the screenshot below to take a look at the Static Maps API in action.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href\u003d\"http://updates.orbitz.com/mobile/airports/ORD/traffic\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src\u003d\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_T1lquhCmKo8/R-vtb_30h3I/AAAAAAAAAVc/wsyUKNCrEqU/s400/ord_traffic.png\"/\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOriginally when starting work on this feature, I of course wanted to use things like clickable markers, custom icons, and so on.  But the thing to remember about mobile users is that they are on the go and have limited time to look at your map.  Therefore it is best to keep the information as simple and bare bones as possible, as to limit the amount of time needed to interpret what they are seeing.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nInstead of custom icons, we used colors to contrast traffic markers from the central airport marker.  We found the blue icon drew enough attention that it was the central focal, when surrounded by red icons (our traffic incidents).  Additionally, the red color was enough to associate markers on our mobile version of severe traffic incidents with those found on our web site that uses a custom red triangle icon.  Also by using labeled markers for the traffic incidents, and no label for the airport, we were able to further create a simple interpretation of traffic markers versus the airport maker.  Finally, since most users are used to the alphabet markers signifying a list of similar points on things like maps.google.com, it was enough to help us associate the list of traffic incidents on the map with their specific traffic details located below the map.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThere were only two big concerns we found when creating this mobile map: icon size and lack of numbered icons.  Since most mobile devices are phone-based, screen size (and thus map size) tends to be limited.  As you can see in the example above, there are several times where the icons overlap and make the map look cluttered.  If a smaller version of the icons were available, it could reduce the number of overlapping markers and make clear the position of the traffic incidents. Another issue with the icons is that the use of alphabet letters as labels has an inherent limitation, in that you can only place 26 different icons on one map. Because our non-mobile version of the traffic page can list over a hundred distinct incidents, we use numbers there to label those icons.  If numbered icons were available for static maps, we could display additional traffic incidents on the mobile map.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs always, the Google Maps API team and I welcome comments and questions on this article, the mobile feature mentioned, and the Static Maps API.

However if you are like me, the thought of having to tackle server-side scripting sends you running for the hills. Fortunately, the recent release of forms for Google Spreadsheets means it is now possible (with just a tiny bit of hacking and wizardry) to create a user contributed map without any server-side scripting and with the added bonus of Google hosting the data for you.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe first step is to create a form for Google Spreadsheets at this page. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe information that we need in order to add a contributor to our map is their name, latitude, and longitude. Of course, if you want more information on your map, you can always add more fields to the form later.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe first question we will ask is ‘What is your name?’. Type this into the ‘Question Title’ box. The default question type is ‘text’ - leave this as it is. After you have completed the ‘Question Title’ press ‘save’.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNow add the second question by clicking ‘+ Add a question’ and this time type ‘Latitude’ in the Question Title box. Again leave the question type as 'text' and press ‘save’ again.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdd one more question with ‘Longitude’ as the ‘Question Title’.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe second step (and the only one that requires some coding) is to hack the generated spreadsheet form so that instead of having to type in a latitude and longitude manually, our users can just click on a map to show where they live. To do this, we create a map and then assign an event listener for the map \u003ccode\u003e'click'\u003c/code\u003e event that writes the values of the clicked coordinate into the form input fields. The code that accomplishes that is shown below:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\nvar map \u003d new GMap2(document.getElementById(\"map_canvas\"));\nmap.setCenter(new GLatLng(37.4419, -122.1419), 13);\nmap.addControl(new GSmallMapControl());\nmap.addControl(new GMapTypeControl());\n\nGEvent.addListener(map, 'click', function(overlay, latlng) {\n  var LatLngStr \u003d \"Lat \u003d \" + latlng.lat() + \", Long \u003d \" + latlng.lng();\n  map.openInfoWindow(latlng, LatLngStr);\n  document.getElementById(\"latbox\").value \u003d latlng.lat();\n  document.getElementById(\"lonbox\").value \u003d latlng.lng();\n});\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe full HTML for the form and map is \u003ca href\u003d\"http://keirclarke.googlepages.com/getlatlong.htm\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. This page extracts the latitude and longitude when a user clicks on the map and automatically fills in the input boxes for latitude and longitude in the spreadsheet form, and also lets the user fill in their name. The important things to remember about modifying the generated spreadsheet form is that the form field names remain the same (e.g. the name for the latitude input is 'single:2'), and that the form action remains the same (e.g. 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/formResponse?key\u003dpHxwMuyQhRdSwN9QcKaqWVA'). \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nNow that you understand how the simple map-based form works, feel free to hack it further.
